# Horiseon-Accessibility



This is my submission for the first challenge in Rutger's Coding Bootcamp.

I was given starter code for the landing page of Horiseon, a company that provides social solution services. I needed to refractor the website and make it more accessible. 

I did this by adding:
 - semantic html elements
 - image alt attributes
 - adding a concise title
 - a logical strcture of styling and positioning

 I also was sure to follow the scout rule and left the code cleaner than I found it by cleaning up the css. I removed redundant classes, organzied the code and left comments.

I learned a lot about the important of accessibility in the web design when completing this assignment.
